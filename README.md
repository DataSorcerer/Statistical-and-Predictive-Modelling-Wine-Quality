> *"Wine is bottled poetry"* - Robert Louis Stevenson

The words of famous Scottish novelist and poet cannot be more true! 
We always wonder, what separates an average wine from great. Wouldn't it be interesting to delve into this problem and resort to good old statistical analysis to find the answer?    
Fortunately, UC Irvine ML repository already has us covered with a wonderful [Wine Quality Data Set](!https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality). It has two datasets are included, related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available.     

**Objective:**    
The goal of the following analysis is model wine quality based on its physicochemical attributes    

**Stepwise Analysis:**    
A systematic approach is followed through these steps:   
1. Data preprocessing & feature engineering    
2. Exploratory analysis:    
    2.1. Descriptive statistics    
    2.2. Inferential statistics    
    2.3. Univariate analysis    
    2.4. Multivariate analysis     
(All the analysis is accompanied by appropriate chart/ plots that aid in visual exploration of trends/ relationships in attributes)
